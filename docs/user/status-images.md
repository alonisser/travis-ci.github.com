### What This Guide Covers

This guide covers the build status images feature of Travis CI. Status images are part of the HTTP API that render build status information (passing or failing) as a PNG image. Developers are encouraged to add them to project sites, README files and so on both to link to continuous integration page for the project and to demonstrate their commitment to good software development practices.

We recommend you start with the [Getting Started](/docs/user/getting-started/) and [Build Configuration](/docs/user/build-configuration/) guides before reading this one.

## Status Image URLs

After adding your project to Travis, you can use the status buttons to show the current status of your projects in your `README` file on GitHub or your project website.

    https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME].png

Only a HTTPS endpoint is provided, which is good as GitHub does not cache images served from HTTPS.

## Adding Status Images to README Files

When using Textile, showing your status button (including a link to your Travis project page) is as simple as adding this to your `README`:
    "!https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME].png!":https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]

Or if you're using markdown:

    [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME].png)](https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME])

Or RDoc:

    {<img src="https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME].png" />}[https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]]

Or Rst:

    .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME].png
       :target: https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]


Travis CI's own status button looks like this: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis-ci.png)](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis-ci)

## Build Status For Specific Branches

You can limit the impact of this button to certain branches only. For example, you might not want to include feature branches, which might fail but don't mean the project itself fails.

Specify a `?branch=` parameter in the URI. Split branches with a comma if you want to specify several.

    https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME].png?branch=master,staging,production
